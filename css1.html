    <h2>Saturday Morning Webtoons: THE REMARRIED EMPRESS </h2>
    <p>Alphatart and Sumpul partnered together to bring the royal fantasy series <i> The Remarried Empress</i> to life.
         It follows Navier Ellie Trovi â€“ the perfect empress. She is intelligent, courageous and socially adept. Navier is kind to her subjects and devoted to her husband, who she has known she was a child. 
         However, things go south when her husband, the emperor, brings home a mistress. Navier tries to live with the situation and is content with living the rest of her days as the empress of the Eastern Empire.
          That is, of course, until the Emperor demands a divorce. She agrees under one condition, <i>she is allowed to remarry.</i></p>
