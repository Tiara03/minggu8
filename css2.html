    <h2>LIKE WIND ON A DRY BRANCH</h2>
    <p><i>Like Wind on a Dry Branch</i> is a fairly new Webtoon but really packs quite the emotional punch. 
        Rieta has suffered in some of the worst ways but continues to help others. 
        She has a strong group of supportive women who live and work together in this safe haven that Killian has created. 
        How they portray <i>Rieta and Killian’s</i> relationship is refreshing as well. He may pretend to be this bad boy, but he really does care about those who depend on him. He never uses his power to demand anything of Rieta but actually allows her to flourish independently and only wishes to support her. 
        There isn’t quite a lot of world-building (yet), but if the first twenty are any indication, this will be one of my favorite series yet.</p>
