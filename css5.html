    <h2>A Vacation In Switzerland Around Lake Leman </h2>
    <p>It has been long since I had a vacation, so my wife and I, decided to travel abroad for a week. After some thinking, we decided to travel to Switzerland, hire a car, and drive around lake Leman <b class="pink">(also known as lake Geneva)</b>.
        With today’s technology, you don’t have to leave home to take care of the flight tickets or hire a car. You can order the flight, print the tickets, and even hire a car and print the voucher with your home printer, and that’s what we did.
        We flew to Geneva, Switzerland, and arrived in the afternoon. We received our hired car at the airport, and from there, drove out of Geneva, along the lake. Since it was becoming late, we found a small and nice hotel, right on the bank of the lake at Nyon.
        We did not reserve any room before we traveled. There are so many hotels in Switzerland, so we just drove, and in the late afternoon looked for hotels. The hotels in Switzerland are quite expensive, but they are clean and pleasant, of high quality, and they usually include breakfast.
        We arrived to Tasch, a small town not far from Zermatt, and parked the car in a very big parking lot near the train station. From there, we travelled by train for about 15 minutes to Zermatt, a town situated at the bottom of the Matterhorn, at about 1600 meters above sea level.
        When we arrived, we were told that it was too late to climb, and so had to return the next day. We drove back down to Randa, where we stayed in a nice and pleasant hotel, the Matterhorn Golf Hotel, run by a warm and a friendly Italian couple.
        Next morning, after an interesting conversation about the Internet and websites with Maurizio, the owner of the hotel, we drove again to the train station at Tasch, and took the train to Zermatt.</p>
